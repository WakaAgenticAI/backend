# Project TODOs

- After you install psycopg and confirm, I’ll re-run migrations to create the chat tables.
- Then I can:
  - Add inventory endpoints and reservation on order create.
  - Add forecasts API and daily stub.
  - Add finance endpoints (reports/webhook) and minimal fraud checks.
  - Add audit_logs persistence, request ID middleware, and rate limiting.
